## PHP Coding Challenge

### Introduction
Your local store need simple cataloging system as a REST API so that they can integrate that API with mobile and desktop applications in the future.

You are free to use any PHP libraries or modules in order to complete the challenge.

**Use any PHP framework, but we prefer Symfony.**

### Requirements

The API should be able to:
* list all products
* list all categories
* retrieve a single product
* create a product
* update a product
* delete a product
* get total value of all products that are in store

#### Data

Products have the following attributes:
* name
* category
* SKU
* price
* quantity

Categories have the following attributes:
* name

#### Optional
* Use PHPUnit or Codeception tests
* Entities have timestamp fields (created_at, and updated_at)
* Entities have blameable fields (created_by, and updated_by)
* Authentication. Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete a product. No authentication is required to retrieve or list.
* Logging (If authentication is implemented, show who and when updated entity)
